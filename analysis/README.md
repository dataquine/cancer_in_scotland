# Analysis

Analysis was broken down by working on 4 different datasets.
For convenience you may wish to read the combined report 

* [`0_analysis_report_cancer_in_scotland`](0_analysis_report_cancer_in_scotland.html)

The combined report joins all 4 of the following together.

* `1_analysis_death`
* `2_analysis_incidence`
* `3_analysis_screening`
* `4_analysis_waiting_times`

Or you can examine each individual analysis on its own by reading each of the 4 
separate analysis files, numbers 1-4 are a suggested reading order.
